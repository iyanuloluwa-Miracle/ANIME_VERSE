# animeverse

AnimeVerse is a web application that allows users to search for their favorite anime titles. Users can enter the name of an anime in the search bar, and the application will fetch relevant data from an external API (such as Jikan API) and display information about the anime, including its title, poster image, and other details. The application provides a user-friendly interface for anime enthusiasts to explore and discover new anime titles. With AnimeVerse, users can easily find information about their favorite anime series and movies all in one place.
